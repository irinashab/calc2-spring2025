<h1 class="title">More on Infinite Series</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="divergence-test">Divergence Test</h2>
<p>Geometric series are particularly nice, but there are other series as well. Let’s look at the constant series <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. It should be clear that it diverges: the partial sums are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2, \frac{5}{2}, ...\)</span> which continue to get bigger and bigger. Similarly, the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1000000}\)</span> also diverges, even if it grows pretty slowly. Moreover there is a nice theorem that generalizes both of these:<br />
<br />
<strong>Theorem</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n \neq 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n\)</span> diverges.<br />
<br />
That is: if the limit of a sequence either does not exist, or exists but is not 0, then the sum of that sequence diverges. This is known as the <strong>Divergence Test</strong> .<br />
<br />
For example, the series <span class="math inline">\(0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{5} + \ldots\)</span> diverges, since the sequence can be written as <span class="math inline">\(a_n = \frac{n}{n+1}\)</span>. This sequence approaches <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and so the series diverges.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="converse">Converse?</h2>
<p>The Divergence Theorem tells you directly which series diverge. But does it tell you anything about which series must converge? Not necessarily. For example,  the “Harmonic Series” 
diverges! It goes off to infinity quite slowly, but it does, in fact, go off to infinity. We will explore its divergence later.</p>
<h2 id="integral-test">Integral Test</h2>
<p>One way to tell is by graphing the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)</span> and drawing in the “Riemann sum” approximations.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/integraltest.png" alt="image illustrates the integral test" width="500" /></p>
<p><br />
Figure 5.12 from your textbook: the sum of <span class="math inline">\(1+1/2+1/4+...+1/n+...\)</span> is lager than the integral from 1 to infinity of <span class="math inline">\(1/x\)</span>. Notice that the rectangles are all above the graph, and, therefore, we can see: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \geq \int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx\]</span> Further, we know how to compute this integral: since the antiderivative of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span>, this integral can be computed as the limit as <span class="math inline">\(b \rightarrow \infty\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\ln(b) - \ln(1)\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. Therefore, the series must also diverge.<br />
<br />
Now let’s look at the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}\)</span>. We can similarly compare it to the integral of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}\)</span>. In fact, there are two ways we can compare it:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wc9vzgz5qp?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe><p>and</p>
<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z1gotag5l5?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
<p>Notice that this means that if <span class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx\]</span> converges, then so does <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}\]</span> and if the integral diverges, then so does the series. And, again, we know how to compute the integral: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;\lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2} dx \\
    &amp;= \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} (-\frac{1}{b} + 1) \\
    &amp;= 1
 \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the integral converges, the series also converges. This is known as the <strong>Integral Test</strong>:<br />
suppose <span class="math inline">\((a_n)\)</span> is a sequence of positive terms, and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is a function with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is decreasing</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is continues</p></li>
<li><p>there is some <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(n\geq N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_n = f(n)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Them either <span class="math inline">\(\int_N^{\infty} f(x) dx \textrm{ and } \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} a_n\)</span> both converge or they both diverge. Note that this does not necessarily mean that they both converge to the same value: we can see that the integral of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x^2}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> converged to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. But the series actually converges to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\)</span>: this is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem">Basel problem</a></p>
    <h1 class="title">Nicole Oresme</h1>

 <p><img src="assets/images/noresm.png" alt="image of Nicole Oresme " width="300" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I indeed know nothing except that I know that I know nothing.<br />
— Nicole Oresme</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nicole Oresme (1323–1382) was a brilliant philosopher, psychologist, economist, mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and musicologist, a passionate theologian, a competent translator, counselor of King Charles V of France, Bishop of Lisieux, one of the principal founders of modern sciences, probably the most original thinker of the 14th century and — so to speak — the "French Einstein of the 14th century."<br />
There is a long tradition that says that Nicole Oresme was also the tutor to the dauphin (who later became Charles V), but this is not quite certain. Charles appeared to have had the highest esteem for Oresme’s character and talents, often followed his counsel, and made him write many works in French for the purpose of popularizing the sciences and of developing a taste for learning in the kingdom.</p>
<h1 id="oresmes-contribution-to-mathematics">Oresme’s Contribution to Mathematics</h1>
<p>In his works, Oresme mentioned concepts translated as <em>longitude</em> and <em>latitude</em>. This was a seed from which the idea of an orthogonal coordinate system grew. He showed that his method of determining the latitude of forms could be applied to the movement of a point, provided that time is taken as longitude and speed as latitude; quantity is then the space covered in a given time.</p>
<p>Nicole was also fascinated by the Greeks’ discovery that the infinite series of the reciprocals of powers of 2 converges to 2.</p>
<p>Consider: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n} + \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>The partial sums are: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 2 - \frac{1}{2},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{4} = 2 - \frac{1}{4},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{15}{8} = 2 - \frac{1}{8},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{31}{16} = 2 - \frac{1}{16},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\vdots\]</span></p>
<p>We observe the pattern: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^n}.\]</span></p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^n \to \infty\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2^n} \to 0\)</span>, and thus the sum approaches 2.</p>
<h1 id="harmonic-series">Harmonic Series</h1>
<p>Oresme also considered the sum of the reciprocals of all integers: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} + \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>Unlike the powers of 2, this sum increases without bound and diverges to infinity. To see this, group the terms as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{9} + \cdots + \frac{1}{16},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{17} + \cdots + \frac{1}{32},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\vdots\]</span></p>
<p>Each group has <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \dots\)</span> terms, respectively. Each term in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th group is greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2^{k}}\)</span>, so each group’s sum is larger than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. Thus, by continuing indefinitely, we can collect infinitely many halves, and therefore the harmonic series diverges.</p>
<p>Geometrically there are infinite blue rectangles each with area 1/2, yet their total area is exceeded by that of the grey bars denoting the harmonic series.</p>
 <p><img src="assets/images/hseriesdiv.png" alt="image illustrates divergence of harmonic series geometrically" width="500" /></p>

<p>Nicole Oresme’s proof of the divergence of the harmonic series fell into obscurity and was rediscovered in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jacob Bernoulli.</p>
<h1 id="why-the-name-harmonic">Why the Name "Harmonic"?</h1>
<p>The name "harmonic" comes from music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, etc., of the string’s fundamental wavelength.</p>
 <p><img src="assets/images/hseries.png" alt="image of a wave and its harmonics, with wavelengths 1, 1/2,1/3 " width="500" /></p>
<p>Harmonic sequences were popular among Baroque architects, who used them to establish proportions of floor plans, elevations, and harmonic relationships between architectural details.</p>
     <p><img src="assets/images/seriesarch.png" alt="image of Baroque interier " width="500" /></p>
                                                                                                                                                                                             
<p>Infinite series became extremely important in the 17th and 18th centuries, allowing mathematicians to compute values of logarithms, roots, and trigonometric functions with high precision.</p>
<h1 id="series-for-pi">Series for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span></h1>
<p>The seventeenth-century German mathematician and philosopher Leibniz (1646–1716) discovered the following series for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = 4\left(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{11} + \cdots\right)\]</span></p>
<p>It is remarkable that the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter is four times the alternating sum of the reciprocals of all odd numbers.</p>
<p>In the TV series <em>Star Trek</em>, Spock defeats an evil computer by asking it to compute the last digit of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is irrational, it has no "last" digit.</p>
<h1 class="title">Power Series</h1>
</header>
<p>Polynomial functions are the easiest functions to work with in calculus. They are continuous and differentiable everywhere, we can use the power rule to take derivatives, and the “reverse” power rule to find antiderivatives. These techniques are so powerful that students often mistake all functions for polynomials (perhaps due to a bit of wishful thinking).</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could approximate any function we want using polynomials. Recall that in Calculus I, we found linear approximations to functions using derivatives. Indeed, the tangent line to the graph of a function stays really close to the function itself. Take a look at this graph of <span class="math inline">\(y=e^x\)</span> and the tangent line at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=x+1\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/linearappr.png" alt="image of linear approximations to functions using derivatives" width="500"/></p>
<p>Notice that really close to <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, the graphs almost overlap. That means that the graph of <span class="math inline">\(y=x+1\)</span> <em>approximates</em> the graph of <span class="math inline">\(y=e^x\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>. In general, given a graph <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> the tangent line to the graph at <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> is the best linear approximation of the function <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[y = f(a) + f^\prime(a) (x - a)\]</span> We can similarly find quadratic approximations or cubic approximations to functions. This is the idea behind <strong>power series</strong> (or more specifically, <strong>Taylor series</strong>).<br />
<br />
<strong>Definition</strong>: A <strong>power series</strong> is an infinite sum of polynomials.<br />
<br />
For example, we will be studying the following power series:<span class="math display">\[p(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} x^n\]</span> Notice that when we plug in a number for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we get an infinite series, and we can determine if converges or not for that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (using the convergence tests we learned recently).<br />
<br />
<strong>Example</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(p(x)=1 + x + x^2 + \ldots\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(0)=1\)</span> (converges)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(1)=1+1+1+\ldots\)</span> (diverges)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(-1)=1-1+1-1\ldots\)</span> (also diverges)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(\frac{1}{2})=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\ldots=2\)</span> (converges)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(2)=1+2+4+8\ldots\)</span> (diverges)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally: <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> converges for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;1\)</span>, and diverges otherwise. This is because it’s a geometric series! In particular, we even know what it converges to: the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum x^n\)</span> is a geometric series with <span class="math inline">\(a=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r=x\)</span>, and so it converges to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1-x}\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;1\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="derivatives-and-integrals">Derivatives and Integrals</h2>
<p>The nice thing about power series is that we can use the normal rules for derivatives and integrals of polynomials. For example, since <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \ldots\)</span> , <span class="math display">\[p^\prime(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \ldots\]</span></p>
<p>Symbolically, we can do something very similar using the closed form for the series. Since <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n\)</span>, taking the derivative of each term we get <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime(x) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} nx^{n-1}\)</span>. Notice that when we take the derivative, the <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> term goes away (since the derivative of a constant is 0). We can then re-write <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime(x) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} nx^{n-1}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+1) x^n\)</span>, by shifting the value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> over by one.<br />
<br />
Similarly, we can integrate, term-by-term, the series <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \ldots\)</span> and, since <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(|x|&lt;1\)</span>, this will be the same as integrating <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{1 - x}\)</span> , at least for those <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in that interval, <span class="math display">\[\int \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n dx = C + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\]</span><br />
Or: <span class="math inline">\(\int p(x) dx = C + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n}\)</span><br />
Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\int \frac{1}{1-x} dx = -\ln|1 - x| + C\)</span>, and so for <span class="math inline">\(|x|&lt;1\)</span>, this gives us a power series representation for <span class="math inline">\(-\ln|1-x|\)</span>. In particular, when <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ln|1|=0\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(-\ln|1 - x| = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n}\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(|x|&lt;1\)</span>.<br />
<br />
This series converges for all <span class="math inline">\(|x|&lt;1\)</span>, similar to the series <span class="math inline">\(1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots\)</span>. What about if <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x=-1\)</span>?<br />
<br />
If <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> we get the harmonic series <span class="math inline">\(\sum \frac{1}{n}\)</span>, which we know diverges (using the integral test).<br />
<br />
If <span class="math inline">\(x=-1\)</span> , we get the <em>alternating</em> harmonic series <span class="math inline">\(\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n}\)</span>, which converges (using the alternating series test). And now we can actually see why <span class="math inline">\(\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n}\)</span> converges to <span class="math inline">\(\ln(2)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    -\ln(1 - (-1)) &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \\
    -\ln(2) &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \\
    \ln(2) &amp;= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \\
    \ln(2) &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\end{aligned}\]</span> And so the series <span class="math inline">\(1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \ldots\)</span> converges to <span class="math inline">\(\ln(2)\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="radius-of-convergence">Radius of Convergence</h2>
<p>We have studied the functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}\)</span> and its “power series representation” <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n\)</span>. We notice that <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> converges for <span class="math inline">\(|x|&lt;1\)</span>.<br />
<br />
Specifically, we have looked at power series centered around <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>. A power series centered at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> looks like a function of the form <span class="math display">\[f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> is an infinite sequence. Since <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots\)</span>, if we plug <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, we get <span class="math inline">\(f(0)=a_0\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span> converges! What if <span class="math inline">\(x \neq 0\)</span>? There are three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> might converge for <strong>all</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> might diverge for <strong>all</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x\neq 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>there is some real number <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that if <span class="math inline">\(-R&lt;x&lt;R\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> converges</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That third point can be stated as "<span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> converges in some interval of radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> centered around <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.” If <span class="math inline">\(x=R\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x=-R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> may or may not converge (more specific analysis might be needed for that).<br />
<br />
More generally, we could study series centered at any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-value. A series centered at <span class="math inline">\(x=5\)</span> might look like <span class="math display">\[p(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (x - 5)^n\]</span> Or even more generally, a power series centered at <span class="math inline">\(x=x_0\)</span> would look like<span class="math display">\[p(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (x - x_0)^n\]</span> Notice that <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = a_0 + a_1 (x - x_0) + a_2 (x-x_0)^2 + \ldots\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(p(x_0) = a_0 + 0 + 0 + \ldots\)</span><br />
Therefore <span class="math inline">\(p(x_0)\)</span> converges! Similarly, there are three possibilities for whether <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> converges for <span class="math inline">\(x\neq 0\)</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> might converge for <strong>all</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> might diverge for <strong>all</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x\neq 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>there is some real number <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that if <span class="math inline">\(-R&lt;x-x_0&lt;R\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> converges</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is referred to as the radius of convergence of the power series around <span class="math inline">\(x=x_0\)</span>. In case (1), we say that the radius of convergence is <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, and in case (2), the radius of convergence is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="determining-the-radius-of-convergence">Determining the radius of convergence</h2>
<p>How do we find the radius of convergence? We use the ratio test. For example, let’s look at the power series <span class="math inline">\(\sum \frac{x^n}{n}\)</span>. Applying the ratio test to the terms of this series, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n + 1}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_{n} = \frac{x^{n}}{n}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dividing, we get <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x^{n+1}}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{n}{x^n} = x \cdot \frac{n}{n+1}\)</span>. Now we look at the limit as <span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(|x \cdot \frac{n}{n+1} |\)</span>, which is just <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span>. Since the ratio test says that the series converges absolutely if <span class="math inline">\(L&lt;1\)</span>, we see that we must have <span class="math inline">\(|x|&lt;1\)</span>. Therefore our radius of convergence is 1.<br />
<br />
<strong>Example</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x^n}{n!}\)</span><br />
<br />
Lastly we look at the series <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}\)</span>. This is the series <span class="math inline">\(1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \ldots\)</span>.<br />
<br />
Notice two things about this series:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(1 + 0 + 0 + \ldots = 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f^\prime(x) = 1 + \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{3x}{6} + \frac{4x}{24} + \ldots\)</span> and is we simplify these fractions, we’ll see:<br />
<span class="math inline">\(f^\prime (x)=f(x)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is a solution to an initial value problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(y^\prime=y\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(y(0)=1\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we try to solve this using our methods of solving differential equations, we would get <span class="math inline">\(y=e^x\)</span>. This means, if the power series <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> converges, it must converge to <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span>! So let’s see where it actually converges by finding the radius of convergence.<br />
<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1} = \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_n = \frac{x^n}{(n)!}\)</span>, we can compute the ratio: <span class="math display">\[|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = |\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \cdot \frac{n!}{x^n}|\]</span> Simplifying, we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac{|x|}{n+1}\]</span> As <span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span> the expression approaches 0 <strong>no matter what <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is</strong>.Therefore this power series <strong>converges absolutely</strong> for every <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In particular, we see that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=e^x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.<br />
<br />
Take a look at this animation on Desmos, which shows that as we take more and more terms of this infinite sum, we get a polynomial that approximates the graph of <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span> really well:</p>
