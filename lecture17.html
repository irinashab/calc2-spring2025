<h1 class="title">More on Infinite Series</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="divergence-test">Divergence Test</h2>
<p>Geometric series are particularly nice, but there are other series as well. Let’s look at the constant series <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. It should be clear that it diverges: the partial sums are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2, \frac{5}{2}, ...\)</span> which continue to get bigger and bigger. Similarly, the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1000000}\)</span> also diverges, even if it grows pretty slowly. Moreover there is a nice theorem that generalizes both of these:<br />
<br />
<strong>Theorem</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n \neq 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n\)</span> diverges.<br />
<br />
That is: if the limit of a sequence either does not exist, or exists but is not 0, then the sum of that sequence diverges. This is known as the <strong>Divergence Test</strong> .<br />
<br />
For example, the series <span class="math inline">\(0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{5} + \ldots\)</span> diverges, since the sequence can be written as <span class="math inline">\(a_n = \frac{n}{n+1}\)</span>. This sequence approaches <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and so the series diverges.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="converse">Converse?</h2>
<p>The Divergence Theorem tells you directly which series diverge. But does it tell you anything about which series must converge? Not necessarily. For example,  the “Harmonic Series” 
diverges! It goes off to infinity quite slowly, but it does, in fact, go off to infinity. We will explore its divergence later.</p>
<h2 id="integral-test">Integral Test</h2>
<p>One way to tell is by graphing the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)</span> and drawing in the “Riemann sum” approximations.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/integraltest.png" alt="image illustrates the integral test" width="500" /></p>
<p><br />
Figure 5.12 from your textbook: the sum of <span class="math inline">\(1+1/2+1/4+...+1/n+...\)</span> is lager than the integral from 1 to infinity of <span class="math inline">\(1/x\)</span>. Notice that the rectangles are all above the graph, and, therefore, we can see: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \geq \int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx\]</span> Further, we know how to compute this integral: since the antiderivative of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span>, this integral can be computed as the limit as <span class="math inline">\(b \rightarrow \infty\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\ln(b) - \ln(1)\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. Therefore, the series must also diverge.<br />
<br />
Now let’s look at the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}\)</span>. We can similarly compare it to the integral of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}\)</span>. In fact, there are two ways we can compare it:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wc9vzgz5qp?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe><p>and</p>
<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z1gotag5l5?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
<p>Notice that this means that if <span class="math display">\[\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx\]</span> converges, then so does <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}\]</span> and if the integral diverges, then so does the series. And, again, we know how to compute the integral: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;\lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2} dx \\
    &amp;= \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} (-\frac{1}{b} + 1) \\
    &amp;= 1
 \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since the integral converges, the series also converges. This is known as the <strong>Integral Test</strong>:<br />
suppose <span class="math inline">\((a_n)\)</span> is a sequence of positive terms, and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is a function with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is decreasing</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is continues</p></li>
<li><p>there is some <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(n\geq N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_n = f(n)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Them either <span class="math inline">\(\int_N^{\infty} f(x) dx \textrm{ and } \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} a_n\)</span> both converge or they both diverge. Note that this does not necessarily mean that they both converge to the same value: we can see that the integral of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{x^2}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> converged to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. But the series actually converges to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\)</span>: this is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem">Basel problem</a></p>
    <h1 class="title">Nicole Oresme</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I indeed know nothing except that I know that I know nothing.<br />
— Nicole Oresme</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="nicole-oresme">Nicole Oresme</h1>
<p>Nicole Oresme (1323–1382) was a brilliant philosopher, psychologist, economist, mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and musicologist, a passionate theologian, a competent translator, counselor of King Charles V of France, Bishop of Lisieux, one of the principal founders of modern sciences, probably the most original thinker of the 14th century and — so to speak — the "French Einstein of the 14th century."<br />
There is a long tradition that says that Nicole Oresme was also the tutor to the dauphin (who later became Charles V), but this is not quite certain. Charles appeared to have had the highest esteem for Oresme’s character and talents, often followed his counsel, and made him write many works in French for the purpose of popularizing the sciences and of developing a taste for learning in the kingdom.</p>
<h1 id="oresmes-contribution-to-mathematics">Oresme’s Contribution to Mathematics</h1>
<p>In his works, Oresme mentioned concepts translated as <em>longitude</em> and <em>latitude</em>. This was a seed from which the idea of an orthogonal coordinate system grew. He showed that his method of determining the latitude of forms could be applied to the movement of a point, provided that time is taken as longitude and speed as latitude; quantity is then the space covered in a given time.</p>
<p>Nicole was also fascinated by the Greeks’ discovery that the infinite series of the reciprocals of powers of 2 converges to 2.</p>
<p>Consider: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n} + \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>The partial sums are: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 2 - \frac{1}{2},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{4} = 2 - \frac{1}{4},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{15}{8} = 2 - \frac{1}{8},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{31}{16} = 2 - \frac{1}{16},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\vdots\]</span></p>
<p>We observe the pattern: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^n}.\]</span></p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^n \to \infty\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2^n} \to 0\)</span>, and thus the sum approaches 2.</p>
<h1 id="harmonic-series">Harmonic Series</h1>
<p>Oresme also considered the sum of the reciprocals of all integers: <span class="math display">\[1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} + \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>Unlike the powers of 2, this sum increases without bound and diverges to infinity. To see this, group the terms as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{9} + \cdots + \frac{1}{16},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{17} + \cdots + \frac{1}{32},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\vdots\]</span></p>
<p>Each group has <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \dots\)</span> terms, respectively. Each term in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th group is greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2^{k}}\)</span>, so each group’s sum is larger than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. Thus, by continuing indefinitely, we can collect infinitely many halves, and therefore the harmonic series diverges.</p>
<p>Nicole Oresme’s proof of the divergence of the harmonic series fell into obscurity and was rediscovered in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jacob Bernoulli.</p>
<h1 id="why-the-name-harmonic">Why the Name "Harmonic"?</h1>
<p>The name "harmonic" comes from music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, etc., of the string’s fundamental wavelength.</p>
<p>Harmonic sequences were popular among Baroque architects, who used them to establish proportions of floor plans, elevations, and harmonic relationships between architectural details.</p>
<p>Infinite series became extremely important in the 17th and 18th centuries, allowing mathematicians to compute values of logarithms, roots, and trigonometric functions with high precision.</p>
<h1 id="series-for-pi">Series for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span></h1>
<p>The seventeenth-century German mathematician and philosopher Leibniz (1646–1716) discovered the following series for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = 4\left(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{11} + \cdots\right)\]</span></p>
<p>It is remarkable that the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter is four times the alternating sum of the reciprocals of all odd numbers.</p>
<p>In the TV series <em>Star Trek</em>, Spock defeats an evil computer by asking it to compute the last digit of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is irrational, it has no "last" digit.</p>
