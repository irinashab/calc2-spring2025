<h1>Implicit Differentiation</h1>

    <p>An important application of the Chain Rule is called “implicit differentiation”. Consider the following graph of the <em>hyperbola </em>
 \(hy=1\):
        <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/n7gkp43ixo?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
</p>
    <p>How might we find the equation of the tangent line at \(x=1\)? The obvious way would be to solve for \(y\)  and then find the derivative of \(\dfrac{1}{x}\). 
        But we can also differentiate implicitly, meaning “take the derivative of an expression containing  \(y\)”. That is, we can take the derivative of both sides of the equation 
 \(xy=1\), and then use that to figure out what the derivative is when  \(x=1\). The derivative of \(xy\) is, using the product rule, \(x^\prime y + y^\prime x\). Since we know that the derivative of 
\(x\) is \(1\), this simplifies to \( y + y^\prime x\). The derivative of  \(1\) is \(0\), since that’s a constant. So if we take the derivative of both sides, we get:

\[y + y^\prime x=0\]   
        We can then solve for \(y^\prime\) using algebra: subtract \(y\) from both sides and then divide by y = \dfrac{1}{x} to get \(y^\prime = -\dfrac{y}{x}\).
 </p>
<p>
 In the original equation \(xy=1\), when \(x=1\), we can solve for \(y\) and get \(y=1\) also. So we are looking for the equation of the line tangent to \(xy=1\)
 at the point \((1,1)\). Plug in \(x=1\) and \(y=1\) to \(y^\prime = -\dfrac{y}{x}\) and we get  \(y^\prime = -1\).
<p>
So our tangent line would have the equation (\y - 1 = (-1)(x - 1)\), in point-slope form.
</p>
<p>
We used implicit differentiation to write an equation to the graph of \(xy=1\) at a given point. We can use the same technique to  find the (explicit) derivative of \(y = \dfrac{1}{x}\):
    <ul>
        <li>Multiply by \(x\) both parts of \(y = \dfrac{1}{x}\), get \(xy=1\) </li>
        <li>Use mplicit differentiation as before, get \(y + y^\prime x = 0\) </li>
         <li> Solve for \(y^\prime \): \(y^\prime = -\dfrac{y}{x}\)</li>
         </ul>
    This is what we got before, but is still an <em>implicit</em> equation. Instead, we can get an explicit equation, by substituting back in for \(y\):
    since \(y = \dfrac{1}{x}\), we get \[y^\prime = -\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{x} = -\frac{1}{x^2}\]
  
</p>
    <p>Implicit differentiation is covered in the excellent 3Blue1Brown video:</p>

<h2>Exponential Functions</h2>

<p>An exponential function is a function of the form  \(y=b^x\) where \(b\) is some constant. We exclude \(b \leq 0\), since, for negative numbers, 
 \(b^{\frac{1}{2}}\) is not defined, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises:</strong>
<ol>
<li>\(\int\limits_0^{\ln(2)} e^{-x} dx\)</li>
<li>\(\int x e^{-x^2} dx\)</li>
</ol>
</p>
    <p>
        <details>

<ol>
<li>An antiderivative of  \(e^{-x}\) is \(-e^{-x}\), and so plugging in, we get \(-e^{-\ln(2)} = -\frac{1}{2}\), and \(-e^{-0} = -1\), and so our answer is \(-\frac{1}{2} - (-1) = \frac{1}{2}\) .</li>
<li>) Let \(u = -x^2\), so \(du=-2xdx\). Or \(-\frac{{1}}{{2}} du = x dx\). The integral simplifies to \(-\frac{{1}}{{2}} \int e^u du = -\frac{{1}}{{2}} e^u + C\) Substitute back: \(-\frac{{1}}{{2}} e^{-x^2} + C\)</li>
</ol>
</details>
    </p>
    <strong>Interesting note: </strong><br/>
    The function \(f(x) = \frac{e^{-\frac{{1}}{{2}}x^2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\) does not have an elementary antiderivative. In other words, \(\int e^{-x^2}dx\) is not possible to express algebraically, while \(\int xe^{-x^2}dx\) is solvable using a simple substitution. Changing a function very slightly can cause a problem to go from being easy (or at least doable) to impossible!
Moreover, this is not just an academic concern! The function \(f(x) = \frac{e^{-\frac{{1}}{{2}}x^2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\) is known in statistics as the “Gaussian curve” or the “normal distribution”. Areas between points on this curve correspond to probabilities that events occur within a certain number of standard deviations of the mean of a normal distribution. If you haven’t studied statistics, we won’t be studying it here, but I just wanted to point out that this curve is extremely important in understanding distributions of data.

    <h2>Bases other than \(e\)</h2>
    <p>
        What do we do with integrals of exponential functions whose bases are constants other than \(e\)? Recall that \(\ln(x)\) is the inverse of \(e^x\). That means: if \(y = \ln(x)\), then \(e^y = x\). In other words, \(e^{\ln(x)} = x\). So, for example, \(e^{\ln(2)} = 2\). We can use this to rewrite the function \(2^x\). Since \(2 = e^{\ln(2)}\), then \(2^x = {e^{\ln(2)}}^x\). Using exponent rules, we get \(2^x = e^{\ln(2) \cdot x}\). Therefore: \[\int 2^x dx = \int e^{\ln(2) \cdot x} dx = \frac{{1}}{\ln(2)} e^{\ln(2) \cdot x} + C= \frac{2^x}{\ln(2)} + C\]
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Exercise:</strong><br/>
        <ol>
            <li>\(\int 10^x dx\)</li>
            <li>\(\int (\frac{{1}}{{2}})^x dx\)</li>
            <li>\(\int 3^x dx\)</li>
                 
        </ol>
     Do you see the general pattern?  
    </p>
    <h2>Logarithms</h2>
    <p>A <em>logarithm</em> is the inverse of an exponential function. That is, if \(y=b^x\), then \(x = \log_b(y)\), and vice versa: if we are trying to graph 
\(y = \log_b(x)\) for some base, we really should think of this as looking for \((x, y)\) values where \(b^y = x\). </p>
<p>Recall that \(\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x\). This means that \(\int e^x dx = e^x + C\).
 </p>
    <p>To find the derivative of \(y = \ln(x)\), it is easier to reason implicitly using the equation \(e^y = x\). Take the derivative of both sides with respect to \(x\), and we get \(e^y y^\prime = 1\). Then solve for \(y^\prime\) and get \(y^\prime = \dfrac{{1}}{e^y}\). Remember, though, that we used the equation \(e^y = x\), so that means we can substitute \(x\) in for \(e^y\): that is, \(y^\prime = \dfrac{{1}}{{x}}\)! </p>
