    <h1>Lesson 0: Welcome</h1>
    <h2>What is Calculus?</h2>
    <p>What is Calculus? Most of the books jump right into the subject without bothering to define it.</p>
<p>If you have a practical mind, you can look at Calculus as a car driver does. The driver watches the speedometer and odometer on the dashboard. One measures the speed (v), and the other measures the distance traveled (s) at a given instance of time (t). Can you calculate v(t) if you know s(t) and vice versa? The whole subject of calculus is built on the relation of s(t) and v(t). In short, if the odometer record is complete over a journey, but the speedometer information is missing, that information could be recovered. This recovery process is called differentiation, and it is the central idea of differential calculus. We also can compute the distance from a history of the velocity. (That is integration, and it is the goal of integral calculus.)
</p> <p>If you are a romantic person, imagine you were given a magical watch that allows its user to stop time, freezing everything in the universe perfectly still so it can be observed. Thanks to the invention of calculus – a mathematical method for describing bodies in motion – one can freeze and unfreeze time and observe the universe move forward and backward around a chosen moment.

      <h2>Syllabus</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spend some time looking at the <a href="syllabus.html"> cource syllabus </a></li>
<li>Expectation: at least 8 hours of work outside of class per week.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Could be homework or studying.</li>
        <li>“Studying” means: make sure to do lots of practice problems!</li>       
    </ul>
</ul>
    <h2>Prerequisite material</h2>
    <p>I expect that most of you have learned about integrals already in Calculus I. Of course, I’m sure that there are some things that students may have forgotten in the meantime. Coming in, I expect you to know the following:
 <ul>
        <li>The geometric meaning and the limit definition of the “definite integral”.</li>
        <li>The relationship between derivatives and definite integrals (the “Fundamental Theorem of Calculus”).</li> 
     <li>How to use simple derivative facts to evaluate definite integrals</li>
     <ul>
         <li>For example: since \(\frac{d}{dx} (\sin(x)) = \cos(x)\), we can compute \( \int\limits_0^\pi \cos(x) dx\) as \(\sin(\pi)-\sin(0)\) which is just 0.</li>
     </ul>
     <li>Some basic antiderivative facts</li>
     <ul>
         <li>An antiderivative of \(x\) is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \)</li>
         <li>An antiderivative of \(x^2\) is \(\frac{x^3}{3}\)</li>
         <li>The reverse power rule in general: an antiderivative of \(x^n\) (\(x\) to any power) is \(\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\). Increase the power by one and then divide by it!</li>
     </ul>
     <li>An antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{x}\) is \(\ln|x|\), , since the derivative of \(\ln|x|\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\)</li>
     <li><a href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/a-table-of-integrals" target="_blank">Many more in our textbook!</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <p>Ideally, you would also have been introduced to the technique of <strong>integration by substitution</strong>. I know that this is not always covered in every Calculus I course, and so I will talk a bit about it next class.</p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/1-introduction" targert="_blank">Chapter 1 of our textbook</a> covers all of this, from sections 1.1 to 1.4 (and 1.5 is on substitution).</li>
    <li><a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/IntegralsIntro.aspx" target="_blank"> Paul’s Online Notes for Calculus I</a> includes this information as well. This is one of my favorite resources on the internet!
</li>
       <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-2" target="_blank">Khan Academy </a> has many materials reviewing these as well.</li> 
        <li>To truly grasp the <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/essence-of-calculus" target="_blank" >essence of calculus</a>, watch some or all of these videos.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Real Numbers</h2>
<p>Go through the <a href="numbersHandouts.pdf">handout on real numbers</a> with a classmate. Just do side 1 first, then we will discuss as a class, and then work on side 2.</p>
    <p>Topics for discussion:
        <ul>
            <li>What are:</li>
       
    <ul>
    <li>\(\mathbb{N}\) natural numbers? What are they used for?</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{Z}\) integers? Useful for?</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{Q}\) rational numbers? Useful for?</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{R}\) real numbers? Useful for?</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Give an example of a number you know to be irrational, but is not \(\pi\), \(e\)  or a root like \(\sqrt{2}\) or \(\sqrt[3]{5}\)
        <ul>
        <li>\(0.10110111011110\ldots\)</li>
            <li>How do you<strong>know for sure</strong> it is irrational?</li>
            <li>What makes this number <strong>real</strong>?</li>
            <li>Notice that its <em>finite approximations</em> are rational!</li>
            </ul>
</p>
