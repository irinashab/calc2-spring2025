    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Calculus 1, min grade C<br/>
A continuation of MAT 1500. Topics include differentiation and integration of logarithmic, exponential, and inverse trigonometric functions; techniques of integration;
        arc length; infinite series; and improper integrals. Applications include work, growth, and decay problems and volumes of solids of revolution.      
    </p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Upon completion of this course, successful students should be able to</p>
   <ul>
  <li>Use basic derivative facts to compute antiderivatives and definite integrals</li>
  <li>Compute definite and indefinite integrals by choosing appropriate integration techniques</li>
  <li>Solve problems in a range of applications using integration, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Acceleration problems</li>
      <li>Finding centroids of regions</li>
      <li>Areas between curves</li>
      <li>Volumes of solids of revolution</li>
      <li>Arc lengths of curves defined by functions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Model 2-dimensional motion using parametric equations and polar coordinates</li>
  <li>Calculate areas and arc lengths of curves given by parametric equations</li>
  <li>Use convergence tests to determine if an infinite series sums to a finite quantity</li>
  <li>Use Taylor series to approximate transcendental functions by polynomials</li>
  <li>Explain how infinite series is used to understand decimal expansions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Required Textbook</h3>
    <p><a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2" target="_blank">Calculus Volume 2 by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang</a>. This textbook is available for free online and can be downloaded as a PDF or for Kindle.

</p>
    <h3>Required Software</h3>
    <p>For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a <strong>single PDF</strong> of all
        their work and upload the work to Brightspace. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices, my favorite is 
        CamScanner (Android / iOS).</p>
    <p>Another option to submit your written assignments is to use LaTeX. See details on Brightspace. </p>
<h3>MyOpenMath Online Homework</h3>
  <p>We will be using the <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/" target="_blank"> MyOpenMath </a>a>website for online homework. Please register ASAP using the Course ID and Enrollment Key provided on Brightspace.
      Make sure to use your name and Purchase College email address</p>  
    <h3>Calculator Policy</h3>
    <p>A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use online calculators like <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank"> Desmos </a>
        or the built-in Grapher on Mac OS (I call it a hidden treasure). If you would like to have an actual calculator,
        I recommend getting a TI-83+ or TI-84+. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments,
        including exams and quizzes.</p>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
    <p>I understand that there may be times when you miss a class due to emergencies, illnesses, and other reasons. For this reason, I post the lecture notes online. If you miss a class, be sure to submit any work that was due that day, find out what work you missed, and catch yourself up. You can use my office hours or work with others in class to help catch yourself up.

</p>
 <h3>Homework</h3>   
    <p>Homework will be assigned on each topic. Instructions will be posted on Brightspace; it’s your responsibility to check Brightspace regularly. Detailed solutions should be written up neatly, showing <b>ALL</b> of the work. Submitting just answers to the problems will <b>not be counted as homework</b>.<br/>
If you miss a class, it is <b>your</b> responsibility to locate and submit those assignments on time. Missing a class does not grant you an automatic extension on homework submission. 

</p>
    <h3>Late Homework Policy</h3>
    <p>Mathematics is extremely cumulative, so it is important to stay on top of your work when it is assigned. If you miss a class or fall behind, you still need to stay on top of the work that was covered. Do your best to stay current with the work, using all the resources at your disposal to help you.<br/>
If, due to emergencies or illnesses, you require some flexibility, you can reach out to me and we can discuss what you can do to make things up. However, if you fall behind on work and submit work late, I will have less time to actually look at it, grade it and provide meaningful feedback. If work is submitted too late, I reserve the right to simply give it a zero and move on if I do not have time to look at it.
</p>
    <h3>Collaboration Policy/Academic Integrity</h3>h3>
 <p>You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and problem sets with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however.
     There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged.
     Plagiarizing another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per<a href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity" target="_blank">Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy</a>a>.
Collaboration is not allowed on any exam, including take-home exams. We take cheating seriously!
