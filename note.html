  <h2>Notes to Students</h2>
   <p>My experience in teaching calculus tells me that the greatest obstacle to learning calculus is not the new ideas of calculus. These are often easily understood. 
       Rather students find a greater struggle with the prerequisite skills - most notably algebra and trigonometry. No one knows your weaknesses better than you do,
       so you should put in the work where it is needed. Your progress with calculus will be far less difficult if you have a solid understanding of algebra and trig. I can run a review session upon request.</p> 
    <p>An old saying is worth repeating:<strong> Mathematics is not a spectator sport</strong>. No one can learn calculus just listening to the lectures and reading the book. Your engagement and participation are essential. Read the book actively with a pencil and paper. Ask questions if you don't get the material. Seek help early in the process. Work as many exercises as possible. Working exercises will accelerate your learning of calculus more than anything else you do.
