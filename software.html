 <h2>Required Software</h2>

   <p>For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a <strong>single PDF</strong> of all
        their work and upload the work to Brightspace. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices, my favorite is 
        CamScanner (Android / iOS).</p>

<p><h2 id="latex-markup">LaTeX Markup</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how mathematical articles are typed? We do not have symbols on the keyboard for things like exponents, so <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> might not be so easy to write. The letter <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> will certainly not appear on your keyboard, either, and good luck finding the symbol for <span class="math inline">\(\int\)</span>.<br>The answer is called <strong>LaTeX</strong>. LaTeX is a markup language used to typeset academic articles. Academic articles are <strong>not</strong> written in Microsoft Word or Google Docs: while you <em>can</em> get them to understand mathematical equations, it is not standard and somewhat clunky. LaTeX is <strong>the</strong> standard. The pronunciation of Latex as "Latec" is due to the origin of the word. It comes from the Greek word "látex" which is pronounced with a hard "c" sound. As the word entered the English language, the pronunciation was kept consistent with its original form.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>
<p>There are several ways to set up and install LaTeX. If you prefer not to install anything on your local computer, you can create a <strong>free</strong> account on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overleaf.com</a>. This is the simplest way to get up and running.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use LaTeX on your own computer, you will need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A LaTeX distribution: either <a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MacTex</a>, on Mac OS X, or <a href="https://miktex.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MikTex</a> for Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A LaTeX editor: my preference is <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TeXstudio</a>. MikTex and MacTex both come with LaTeX editors, and so you can use those if you like (MikTex comes with TeXworks, MacTex comes with TeXShop), though I prefer TeXstudio.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have written your document in LaTeX, saved as a .tex file, you will be able to compile it to a PDF.</p>
<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic Formatting</h2>
<p>A simple LaTeX file may look something like:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/formatting.png" alt="A simple LaTeX file " width="679"></p>
<p>It can be overwhelming to start a LaTeX document from scratch, so feel free to use the homework files I post to start. I include several packages, macros,and definitions in my preamble.</p>
<h2 id="formatting-math">Formatting Math</h2>
<p>To format math in a LaTeX file, you u<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">se dollar signs to start and end your mathematical notations. Technically this is referred to as “in-line” math mode: for example, to write the sentence “If </span><span class="math inline" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">\(a \neq 0\)</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, then </span><span class="math inline" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">\(ax^2 + bx + c\)</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> is a quadratic polynomial”, you use the following LaTeX syntax:</span></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/poly.png" alt="an example of “in-line” math mode" width="679" height="50"></p>
<p>This is “in-line”, since the math is formatted in the middle of the sentence. There is also “displayed” math mode: you can use two dollar signs ($$) to start and end, and that will display the mathematical content on its own line.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are certain commands we use to put in mathematical notation. For exponents / superscripts we use the caret symbol ( <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{}\)</span> ) etc. There are many good guides to finding basic LaTeX commands for mathematical notation, you can find them below.</p>
